I’m a high school student who finds energy in the intersection of engineering and music—two fields that challenge me in different yet deeply connected ways. My curiosity about how things work has led me to build several computer‑vision projects, including a Pharmaceutical Defect Detection system, a Fruit Quality Inspection solution, and an LED‑status‑monitoring tool for legacy train‑control signaling equipment. These projects have pushed me to think critically, design creatively, and solve real‑world problems with code and algorithms. Music has shaped me just as much. Earning the Royal Conservatory of Music (RCM) Piano Gold Medal across Canada was a milestone that reflects years of dedication, and I bring that same commitment to my ongoing journey with the violin.

Balancing engineering and music has shown me that precision and creativity don’t compete—they strengthen each other. The focus I build through piano and violin carries into my technical work, and the problem‑solving mindset I develop in engineering helps me interpret music with clarity and intention. As I look ahead, I’m motivated by the belief that these passions don’t just coexist—they amplify one another. That’s why I’m working toward Building a Future Where Engineering and Music Resonate in Harmony.
